    "##### Set the context. What problem is this paper trying to solve? Why is this important?\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper I'm covering is \"Kernel Methods on the Riemannian Manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices\". They begin the paper by explaining that Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices are popular for encoding image information and that accounting for the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices allows many algorithms to be used. They then explain that there is issues with approximating the shape of the manifold locally by using the tangent plane of it, mainly that this is only locally viable and doesnt truly represent the true shape of the manifold. Additionally tangent space mapping is highly computationally intensive because logarithmic and exponential maps are used to iteratively map points from the manifold to the tangent space and back again. They then propose that the solution to this problem lies in mapping SPD matrices to a high dimensional Hilbert space where they can then apply Euclidean geometry. In order to do this they introduce a family of positive definite kernels  on the Reimannian manifold of SPD matrices, which are derived from the Gaussian RBF (Radial Basis Function) but augmented with different notions of distances owed to the Log-Euclidean metric. In the end this is valuable because it allows the use of kernel based algorithms developed for standard Euclidean space to be used, while accounting for the geometry of the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices."

    "##### Introduce and explain the model and any necessary mathematical background. Use LaTeX for equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is that we want to use a kernel to embed the manifold in a RKHS, where we can then apply generalized Euclidean algorithms. According to Mercer's theorem this kernel must be positive definite. The Gaussian kernel is a PD kernel in $R^n$. They propose that replacing the Euclidean distance in the Gaussian Kernel with the geodesic distance on the manifold will do this but it must be positive definite. We are working in the space of $dxd$ SPD matrices, and the metric that is proposed is the log-Euclidean metric, which is shown to be a true representation of the geodesic distance on $Sym_d^+$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### In general kernel methods can be generalized to non-manifolds like so:\n",
    "Each point x on a non-linear manifold $M$ is mapped to a feature vector $φ(x)$ in a Hilbert space $H$, the Cauchy completion of the space spanned by real-valued functions defined on $M$. A kernel function $k : (M×M) → R$ is used to define the inner product on H, thus making it a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). According to Mercer’s theorem, however, only positive definite kernels define valid RKHS.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gaussian Radial Basis Function\n",
    "The Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) maps data points to an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. In $R^n$ the Gaussian kernel is $k_G(x_i,x_j):=exp(\\frac{||x_i-x_j||^2}{2\\sigma^2})$. Here the Euclidian distance measure is used. To define this on the Reimannian manifold we use the notion of log-Euclidean Distance defined as $d_g = ||log(X_i)-log(X_j)||_F$ where $||.||_F$ is the frobenius norm induced by the Frobenius inner product. In this way we can accuratley measure the true geodesic distance on $Sym_d^+$ Overall our new kernel can then be written: $k_R(X_i,X_j):=exp(-\\frac{||log(X_i)-log(X_j)||_F^2}{2\\sigma^2})$ and it is also defined as positive definite following Theorem 4.1 in the paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Theorem 4.1. Let (M, d) be a metric space and define $k : (M × M) → R$ by $k(x_i,x_j) := exp(−d^2(x_i,x_j)/2σ2)$. Then, $k$ is a positive definite kernel for all $σ > 0$ if and only if there exists an inner product space $V$ and a function $ψ:M→V$ such that, $d(xi,xj)=∥ψ(xi)−ψ(xj)∥V$. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Kernel PCA on $Sym_d^+$\n",
    "All points $X_i$ are mapped to feature vectors $H$ giving us a transformed set ${\\phi(X_i)}_{i=1}^m$. We then calculate the covariance matrix of the transformed set. This is equivalent to computing the kernel matrix of the original data using $k_R$, the Reimannian Kernel. We then compute the eigenvectors of the kernel matrix. This boils down to a Euclidean representation of the manifold valued data while accounting for the actual geometry of $Sym_d^+$ \n",

    "Here you can see the difference between the Riemannian Metric and the Euclidean Metric similar to what is shown in the paper. The Riemannian Metric performed very well garnering over 90% in all dimensionalities L = [10,11,12,15]. Although it performed well, the amount of computation time was actually quite long, especially when performing the gram matrix computation. I believe in one of the papers outlining the region covariance, \"Region Covariance: A Fast Descriptor for Detection and Classification\", they outline a faster way to do computations, however I did not have time to implement this. \n",
    "\n",
    "In comparison the RBF with Euclidean Metric in place did very poorly, although it was fast. I'm not sure if this is an error? I would assume it is, due to the accuracy measures in the paper being around 90% for all L-dimensional euclidean spaces, but I also understand that implementions will always be different and so I may have not performed the algorithm or pre-processing exactly as they may have. Even performing fitting on the training set it looks like it is struggling to classify points it has already seen, the only thing that seems to help the Euclidean Metric is increasing dimensionality as it gains some ground there and starts to do okay. I tried many fixes and nothing seemed to help aside from increasing the dimesionality. I also tried a standard PCA,(which performed rather well) but that isn't what is outlined in the paper and so it seemed irrelevant. \n",
