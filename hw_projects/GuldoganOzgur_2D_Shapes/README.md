# 2D Geometric Shape Classification 

## File & Folder Descriptions
1 - `./dataset` contains the shapes package from [1]. It is modified to generate 49x49 grayscale geometric shapes. 

2 - `./models` includes the trained models. There is a trained VanillaCNN and SO2SteerableCNN from [2].

## Goal

This project compares the rotation invariance of the VanillaCNN and SO2SteerableCNN for 2D geometric shapes. It shows that the steerable CNNs perform well for rotated inputs.
