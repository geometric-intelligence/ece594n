# Remarks

Here are 2 examples of a great projects (from a different class, i.e. a different topic): [Shadow Removal](https://github.com/bioshape-lab/ece278a/tree/main/projects/Shadow-Removal) and [Single Image Dehazing](https://github.com/bioshape-lab/ece278a/tree/main/projects/Single_Image_dehazing).
