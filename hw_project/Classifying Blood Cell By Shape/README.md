To run the notebook, data should be downloaded from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6496656/files/bloodmnist.npz?download=1) but the file size is too large for a direct upload.

The Jupyter notebooks contain directory references to the dataset and are meant to be run from the same folder containing the folders of images in the dataset. This may require some fine-tuning to work on local machines.
