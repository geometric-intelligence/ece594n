# Projects

Goal: Put your skills in practice to tackle a project of your choice: perform geometric machine learning analysis on a biomedical dataset.

- Deadline for project reports and for presentations in class: Tuesday 05/31/2022 and Thursday 06/02/2022.
- Teams of 2-3 students (5min per student during presentation).

# Grading Criteria

- Project topic: is the question tackled by the project sounded, and is the dataset appropriate to tackle this question?
- Tools: does the project rely on tools taught by this class?
- Experiments: does the project run enough experiments to address the question at hand?
- Software: does the code run?
- Report: is the report (jupyter notebook) well-written and explanatory?
- Presentation: is the presentation clear?

# Remarks

- It is OK to reproduce the results of published papers, e.g. recoding them with Geomstats.
- Here are 2 examples of a great projects (from a different class, i.e. a different topic): [Shadow Removal](https://github.com/bioshape-lab/ece278a/tree/main/projects/Shadow-Removal) and [Single Image Dehazing](https://github.com/bioshape-lab/ece278a/tree/main/projects/Single_Image_dehazing).
